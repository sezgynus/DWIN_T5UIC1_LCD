# DWIN_T5UIC1_LCD

## Python class for the Ender 3 V2 LCD runing klipper3d with Moonraker 

https://www.klipper3d.org

## Setup:

### [Disable Linux serial console](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/uart.md)
  By default, the primary UART is assigned to the Linux console. If you wish to use the primary UART for other purposes, you must reconfigure Raspberry Pi OS. This can be done by using raspi-config:

  * Start raspi-config: `sudo raspi-config.`
  * Select option 3 - Interface Options.
  * Select option P6 - Serial Port.
  * At the prompt Would you like a login shell to be accessible over serial? answer 'No'
  * At the prompt Would you like the serial port hardware to be enabled? answer 'Yes'
  * Exit raspi-config and reboot the Pi for changes to take effect.
  
  For full instructions on how to use Device Tree overlays see [this page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md). 
  
  In brief, add a line to the `/boot/config.txt` file to apply a Device Tree overlay.

### Moonraker connection (refactor branch)

The LCD now connects to Moonraker over HTTP; no direct Klipper socket path or
OctoPrint compatibility endpoint is required. The default URL is
`http://127.0.0.1:7125`. If using a reverse proxy, set its URL explicitly:

```sh
python3 run.py --moonraker-url http://127.0.0.1:80 --request-timeout 5
```

`MOONRAKER_URL` can supply the URL. For installations requiring an API key,
provide `MOONRAKER_API_KEY` in the process environment. Empty keys are not sent.
Do not commit credentials or disable Moonraker authorization.

`--serial-port`, `--encoder-pins A B`, and `--button-pin` configure hardware.
The current pin defaults preserve the existing run.py wiring (21/19 and 13);
set 26/19 explicitly if following the older wiring diagram below.

Commands execute on a dedicated serial worker and expose their result through
Futures. HTTP failures, invalid JSON and timeouts are checked. Failed commands
are never replayed; pending dependent commands are discarded. The LCD displays
a generic failure message and logs the error. Status polling retries after
connection failure without restarting the application; offline input is ignored.
A timed-out command may already have executed: inspect printer state before
issuing it again.

This is the transport foundation. WebSocket subscriptions, a unified UI event
queue and full device capability discovery are subsequent refactor steps.
Existing installation instructions below are still being modernized.

### Library requirements 

  Thanks to [wolfstlkr](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3v2/comments/mdtjvk/octoprint_klipper_v2_lcd/gspae7y)

  `sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-gpiozero python3-serial git`

  `sudo pip3 install multitimer`

  `git clone https://github.com/bustedlogic/DWIN_T5UIC1_LCD.git`


### Wire the display 
  * Display <-> Raspberry Pi GPIO BCM
  * Rx  =   GPIO14  (Tx)
  * Tx  =   GPIO15  (Rx)
  * Ent =   GPIO13
  * A   =   GPIO19
  * B   =   GPIO26
  * Vcc =   2   (5v)
  * Gnd =   6   (GND)

Here's a diagram based on my color selection:

<img src ="images/panel.png?raw=true" width="325" height="180">

I tried to take some images to help out with this: You don't have to use the color of wiring that I used:

<img src ="images/wire1.png?raw=true" width="200" height="400"> <img src ="images/wire2.png?raw=true" width="200" height="400">

<img src ="images/wire3.png?raw=true" width="400" height="200">

<img src ="images/wire4.png?raw=true" width="400" height="300">

### Run The Code

Enter the downloaded DWIN_T5UIC1_LCD folder.
Make new file run.py and copy/paste in the following (pick one)

For an Ender3v2
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from dwinlcd import DWIN_LCD

encoder_Pins = (26, 19)
button_Pin = 13
LCD_COM_Port = '/dev/ttyAMA0'
API_Key = 'XXXXXX'

DWINLCD = DWIN_LCD(
	LCD_COM_Port,
	encoder_Pins,
	button_Pin,
	API_Key
)
```

If your control wheel is reversed (Voxelab Aquila) use this instead.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from dwinlcd import DWIN_LCD

encoder_Pins = (19, 26)
button_Pin = 13
LCD_COM_Port = '/dev/ttyAMA0'
API_Key = 'XXXXXX'

DWINLCD = DWIN_LCD(
	LCD_COM_Port,
	encoder_Pins,
	button_Pin,
	API_Key
)
```

Run with `python3 ./run.py`

# Run at boot:

	Note: Delay of 30s after boot to allow webservices to settal.
	
	path of `run.py` is expected to be `/home/pi/DWIN_T5UIC1_LCD/run.py`

   `sudo chmod +x run.py`
   
   `sudo chmod +x simpleLCD.service`
   
   `sudo mv simpleLCD.service /lib/systemd/system/simpleLCD.service`
   
   `sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/simpleLCD.service`
   
   `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
   
   `sudo systemctl enable simpleLCD.service`
   
   `sudo reboot`
   
   

# Status:

## Working:

 Print Menu:
 
    * List / Print jobs from OctoPrint / Moonraker
    * Auto swiching from to Print Menu on job start / end.
    * Display Print time, Progress, Temps, and Job name.
    * Pause / Resume / Cancle Job
    * Tune Menu: Print speed & Temps

 Perpare Menu:
 
    * Move / Jog toolhead
    * Disable stepper
